Title of the game: CrocMunch
Description: CrocMunch is a mini game where you play as a crocodile trying to eat as many fish as possible while avoiding logs. 
Controls: Use WASD to move
How to play: Use WASD to move. Collect as many fish as possible without bumping into logs or going out of view.
Dev log: I used pixel art because I wanted an old retro feel since this mini-game is simple. I let the player move freely to easily avoid logs. Fish despawn when they collide with the Crocodile, then to create competition I added a scoring system. I also created a mechanic where a lose screen pops up if the player bumps into a log, or goes too far up/down the map. A day before the supposed release of CrocMunch, I accidentally deleted all my scenes in Unity. Through help, I was able to restore them and fix a few bugs. So, next time I hope to back up my files on GitHub better.  
Assets credit: The pixel art is all original and created by me. I learned how to code through Unity's Create with Code and multiple youtube videos.  Youtube creators: "Coco Code", "Unity Mechanics", "Blackthornprod" and "samyam" were very helpful towards the creation of CrocMunch. I occasionally received help from my peers in the Game Design major at FSU.
